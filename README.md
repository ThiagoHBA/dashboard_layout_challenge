# Dashboard Layout Challenge
[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/react)](https://github.com/ThiagoHBA/dashboard_layout_challenge/blob/master/LICENSE) 

This flutter project aims to practice important concepts for the front-end, such as responsive layout and dark theme. The base design was inspired by a project posted on the Dribbble platform, and can be seen at the following link: https://dribbble.com/shots/16009679-CRM-Platform-Dashboard?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=Fireart-d&utm_content=CRM%20Platform%20Dashboard&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=Fireart-d&utm_content=CRM%20Platform%20Dashboard&utm_medium=Social_Share

This application was built with the maximum possible features of the framework itself, using some packages for code quality control and for loading images. 

As the objective of this challenge was to practice some front-end concepts, I decided not to address issues involving the graphics themselves, however, these could be easily implemented in the places assigned to them.
