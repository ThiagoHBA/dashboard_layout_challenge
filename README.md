# Dashboard Layout Challenge
[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/react)](https://github.com/ThiagoHBA/dashboard_layout_challenge/blob/master/LICENSE) 

This flutter project aims to practice important concepts for the front-end, such as responsive layout and dark theme. The base design was inspired by a project posted on the Dribbble platform, and can be seen at the following link: https://dribbble.com/shots/16009679-CRM-Platform-Dashboard?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=Fireart-d&utm_content=CRM%20Platform%20Dashboard&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=Fireart-d&utm_content=CRM%20Platform%20Dashboard&utm_medium=Social_Share

This application was built with the maximum possible features of the framework itself, using some packages for code quality control and for loading images.
